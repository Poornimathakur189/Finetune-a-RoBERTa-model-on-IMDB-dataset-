### Google Colab Notebook:

1. **Introduction**:
   - Brief overview of the task.
   - Description of the dataset (IMDB dataset with 5K instances).
   - Description of the goal (finetuning a RoBERTa model, performing EDA, hyperparameter tuning, training, evaluation, etc.).

2. **Setup**:
   - Import necessary libraries (e.g., PyTorch, transformers, matplotlib, etc.).
   - Mount Google Drive if necessary.

3. **Dataset Split**:
   - Explanation of dataset splitting.
   - Proportion of dataset split (e.g., 80% train, 10% validation, 10% test).

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Overview of the dataset (number of samples, distribution of labels, etc.).
   - Plotting of relevant visualizations (e.g., histogram of label distribution, word cloud of most frequent words, etc.).

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Explanation of hyperparameters considered.
   - Methodology for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search, etc.).
   - Results of hyperparameter tuning and selection of best hyperparameters.

6. **Training**:
   - Training loop implementation.
   - Plotting of loss curves (Loss vs Epochs and Loss vs Steps) for both train and validation datasets.

7. **Evaluation**:
   - Metric used for evaluation (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, etc.) and rationale behind the choice.
   - Plotting of confusion matrix for evaluation on the test dataset.
   - Reporting of results on the test dataset.

8. **Model Performance Analysis**:
   - Analysis of whether the model is properly trained, underfitting, or overfitting.
   - Discussion of possible improvements or next steps.
